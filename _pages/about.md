I investigate **language comprehension** and **acquisition** with a focus on Arabic as a first and second language. I particularly focus on how people recognize written words and acquire syntactic structures.

I am an **independent researcher** and a user of <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> and <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>. I enjoy conducting experimental research and working with statistical models.
